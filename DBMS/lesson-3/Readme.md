# Relational Algebra

Relational Algebra is a procedural query language. Relational algebra mainly provides a theoretical foundation for relational databases and SQL.

These are the **basic/fundamental operators** used in Relational Algebra.

  - Selection(σ)
  - Projection(π)
  - Union(U)
  - Set Difference(-)
  - Set Intersection(∩)
  - Rename(ρ)
  - Cartesian Product(X)
    
### Selection(σ)
It is used to select required tuples of the relations.

###  Projection(π)
It is used to project required column data from a relation. 

### Union(U)
Union operation in relational algebra is the same as union operation in set theory.

### Set Difference(-)
Set Difference in relational algebra is the same set difference operation as in set theory.
